    In-memory state store with copy-on-write semantics.

    This is a thread-safe implementation that stores state in local memory, making it

    rollback on errors, smart copying optimized for Pydantic models, and auto-initialization
    with type inference.

    is not suitable for distributed workflows. For distributed or persistent state, consider
    RedisStateStore for distributed state or PostgresStateStore for persistent state.
