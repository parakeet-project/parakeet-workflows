class WorkflowEngine:
    """
    Executes workflow steps based on event-driven architecture with task-driven runtime.

    The WorkflowEngine manages the execution of decorator-based workflow steps
    by processing events through an event queue. It handles event dispatching,
    parallel step execution (fan-out), and error handling.

    The task-driven runtime allows steps to execute independently and asynchronously,
    with downstream events emitted immediately upon step completion rather than
    waiting for sibling steps to finish.

    The workflow runs until one of these conditions:
    - A StopEvent is received
    - No more work available (empty queue + no active tasks)
    - Deadlock detected (buffered events but no executable steps)

    Attributes:
        workflow: The workflow instance containing decorated step methods.
        queue_wait_timeout: Timeout in seconds for queue operations (default: 1.0s).
        max_workers: Maximum concurrent step executions (default: 100).
        max_tasks: Maximum number of tasks in memory (default: 500).
        max_buffer_size: Maximum number of events that can be buffered (default: 1000).
