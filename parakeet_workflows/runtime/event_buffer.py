    Thread-safe event buffer for multi-event step coordination.

    Stores events until all required events for a step are collected,
    enabling fan-in patterns where a step waits for multiple
    different event types before executing.

    The buffer uses a two-level dictionary structure:
    - First level: keyed by step name
    - Second level: keyed by event type

    Thread Safety:
        All public methods use asyncio.Lock to ensure thread-safe access
        to the internal buffer structure.
